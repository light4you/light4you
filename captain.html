			<h3>Teaching Statement</h3>
      <p>
	One of my teaching philosophy is that business major student should have an excellent problem solving ability. Before joining KAIST (Formerly ICU), I work for ETRI, a well-known national ICT research institute in Korea, for more than 16 years. In ETRI, I conducted various research projects in the area of management, economics and regulatory issues of ICT industry. So I had many research cases which could be used in the class discussion. The interdisciplinary approach becomes one important aspect of technology management school. Based on this philosophy, I designed a unique graduate curriculum particularly customized for global ICT business environment.<br>
	One example of graduate course (MA) for the ICT business student is ‘Issues in the Information and Telecommunication Management’. Of course, there was no textbook available. I designed the course packet in my own way. The course consists of three important subjects specially related to ICT industry: Technology, Regulation and Strategy. Because ICT industry is technology-based, regulated, and fast-changing industry, students should understand all three subjects to enhance problem solving capability. From each of three subjects, two aspects are considered: theory and practice. I selected some classical theories and related real cases from the global ICT market respectively, and then combined them together for the class discussion purpose. When I delivered my own experience to the class, the student response was far more than expected, since the case study was so live and real to them. I believe that this course was a great help to the graduate students when they were working in the ICT industry after graduation.<br> 
	I created another course for MBA program, ‘Strategic Management for ICT Business.” For MBA students, the practical aspects should be more emphasized rather than theoretical aspects. I redesigned a new course focusing on case studies from the domestic and global ICT industry. This course also seemed to be a success to the MBA students. It is evidenced when this course was selected as one of best three courses from all MBA programs in Korea by a well-known newspaper, Maeil Economic Daily in 2007.<br>
	In earlier times, the ICU’s weak brand name as a new university was one problem. ICU was a young and small-sized, specialized university. Although ICU was well recognized as a top tier university to ICT industry experts in Korea, it was not widely known to the general public. I thought that the good brand name is one of the most important factors to attract smart students nationwide. One idea came up to me and I implemented it. I encouraged my graduate students to apply for the student paper competitions as many as possible. My idea was that, if they won the prize in open competition, ICU brand name would become automatically stronger. It was a great success. More than 15 times, SMIT(Strategic Management of Information and Telecommunication) Lab graduate students won the first or the second prizes from various paper competitions sponsored by distinguished global and domestic organizations such as ITS, Samsung, KT, SKT, and major daily newspapers. Owing to this success, they also received good job offers from many global institutes and leading ICT companies such as Seoul Women’s University, BNU-HKBU United International College (China), Samsung, KT, SKT, Alcatel-Lucent and ETRI when they graduated.<br>
      </p>

			<h3>Research Statement</h3>
      <p>
	I have worked in the areas of telecommunications economics and business strategy. I have investigated strategic issues focusing on the relationship among regulatory, business and the consumer behavior in the telecommunications market. More specifically, it includes regulatory issues, corporate and business strategies, marketing, standardization, interconnection, customer behavior and market characteristics in the ICT industry.<br?
	My research achievements can be classified into two periods: before and after joining KAIST (Former ICU). Before joining KAIST, I work for ETRI, a national research institute, for 16 years. During the period at ETRI, I conducted more than 30 research projects related to telecommunications management and economics and regulatory issues. Most study services were provided to the government and public corporations such as KT, as a principal researcher of national research organization.<br>
	In KAIST (including ICU), I made a great effort to raise research funds from outside to support graduate students. As a result, I conducted more than 50 research projects, mostly sponsored by government, research institutes and private ICT companies. My graduate students could access the current ICT industry issues, and thus they could get some idea for their thesis subjects. In turn, by studying current ICT issues at KAIST, they could easily adapt to a new working environment after they graduated. <br>
	In addition to the research reports, I invested my effort to publish academic papers. I published academic papers in the areas of telecommunications management strategy and economics in the various international and domestic refereed journals: 28 SSCI/SCI journals and 44 KCI journals. I also presented our research results in more than 50 international and more than 60 domestic conferences. Some examples of international SSCI/SCI journals include Telecommunications Policy, Information Economics and Policy, Internet Research, Journal of Global Information and Management, Scientometrics, Information Technology and Management, Information Systems and e-Business Management, Management Decision, Psychology & Marketing, Information Development, Telematics and Informatics, Behaviour & Information Technology, and ETRI Journal. <br>
	Published papers were highly cited in this field. For example, one of my paper related to the mobile telecommunication market published in Telecommunications Policy in 2004, is now the most highly-cited (Rank No. 1) among all the papers more than 2221 papers published as of Dec. 2016, in Telecommunications Policy since its launch from 1976. And another paper published in Internet Research in 2005 related to the mobile internet, is cited 4th highest since this journal launched from 1995 (among 989 papers as of Dec. 2016). As of now, my H-index is shown as 10 in the Scopus web site (https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7404491216), and 13 in the Google Scholar. Considering the limited readability because of the specific industry domain and subjects, this performance is recognized as excellent one in the social science academics. (www.scopus.com) [See (6.2) and (6.3) below for details]<br>
	In addition, I published my articles as chapters in 8 books published by Elsevier, IGI publisher and QuantiFica publisher and so on. To disseminate the research findings, I also wrote many non-academic articles in the well-known Korean newspapers as a designated guest columnist for 2 years. In 2007, I was elected a board member of the CPRsouth (Communications Policy Research South). CPRsouth is one of the most influential global academic communities in the regional ICT policy studies. The CPRsouth board members were selected on the basis of academic performance in the academic journals in the world. At that time, nine international scholars were elected from nine countries. I was elected as the representative member of Korea. Being elected as a board member is an honor and is also an evidence to show international recognition of academic research performance in terms of quality in the ICT field.<br>
